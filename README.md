### all-addons

collection of scripts to both enable and facilitate ember observer esq ember-addon health checks.

### what this currently does

For now, it merely provides a mechanism for downloading (and downloading
missing addons). It uses data from emberaddons.com to calculate the npm tarbal,
then proceeds to download the tarbal

### I have an idea

* implement it
* open an issue describing it

####

* `download` aims to quickly download new addons
* `checks/` aims to store various checks â€“ let your imagination run wild
